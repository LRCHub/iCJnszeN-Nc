夢みてる
Love Sick Chicken, Honey
Or even like a bitch in heat
つらいことも あるだろうけど
いつも Bad Days ばかりじゃ
Since he's been gone I cry
涙にくれる日々
夢の中さまようより
Your head is gonna need a rest
眠れないHard day's nightなんか
忘れてしまえば
Don't you worry, Sugar
You got me by your side
Don't you worry, baby
I'll be there when you call
Pa pa pa...If you know just
whatI mean
恋しても悲しいかぎりね
The sunshine always follows rain
夢は夢　通り過ぎてく
He's just another memory
Don't you worry, Sugar
You got me by your side
Don't you worry, baby
I'll be there when you call
Pa pa pa...If you know just
whatI mean
Don't you worry, Sugar
You got me by your side
Don't you worry, baby
I'll be there when you call
Don't you worry, Sugar
You got me by your side
Don't you worry, baby
I'll be there when you call
